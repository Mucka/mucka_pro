            <h1>Website mucka.pro opens for business!</h1>
            <p>Today I officially publish the first version of my personal
            website. The functionality of this version is very limited (close
            to none). There is almost no content. But I needed to start
            somewhere anyway.</p>
            <p>This website was supposed to be built many years ago. It was to
            be a means to organize my notes, projects and ideas. There have
            been many paper projects and prototype versions of this website.
            Eventually none of them saw the daylight. Sad.</p>
            <p>Recently I decided to change approach. I decided to document
            whole process of creating this site on this site itself. So I
            ratted of this template in an hour. Most of this time I have spent
            reading documentation of css and html. Last time when I actually
            used html, was the time when the tag <code>marquee</code> was in
            use. The times have changed. In fact it took me more time to write
            this note than to write this code. I am more fluent in computer
            language than in human language. This note is not even long. Very
            sad.</p>
            <p>This website was created as a collection of static html and css
            files.  Neither server side nor client side have any logic. Website
            does not contain any graphics. I have given up on any graphics
            layout in this version. I planned five language versions of this
            site. I honestly doubt that I am able to keep it up like that.
            Eventually I will give up some of them. Main website is a gateway
            to subsites. As a starting point I created links to two of them:
            <a href="../informatics/news.html">Informatics</a> and
            <a href="../electronics/news.html">Electronics</a>.
            In the long run I would want to have more subsites. Even if some
            of them would be updated only few times per year. I wanted to start
            somewhere, so I start here.
